# Projet-Bibliothèque

DESCRIPTION :
Projet CY-biblioTECH The aim is to create a program to automatically manage the stock of books in a university library. The program should be based on a list of books and users and manage the borrowing and return of books. The application will not only have to indicate if a book has been borrowed and by whom, but also manage the rules of the library such as the duration of loans, the number of books that can be borrowed, etc. There will be two types of users who will not have the same borrowing rights: students and teachers
