# Projet-Biblioth√®que

DESCRIPTION: CY-biblioTECH project involves creating a program to automatically manage the stock of books in a university library. The program should be based on a list of books and users and manage the borrowing and return of books. The application will not only have to indicate if a book has been borrowed and by whom, but also manage the rules of the library such as the duration of loans, the number of books that can be borrowed, etc. There will be two types of users who will not have the same borrowing rights: students and teachers

HOW IT WORKS: First you are asked to login or register. You must follow the on-screen instructions. Then there is a check if you have followed the rules. Thereafter, a menu is displayed, with your number of borrowed books and their titles then you will be asked 4 actions: Borrow, Return, Add or leave.

Connection: enter your id and your password as you registered. Registration: Enter your new id, mdp, selected 1 for teacher or 2 for student. Status means if your account is active or not, and the number of books borrowed is 0 by default.

Borrow: The program will check if you can still borrow a book. The list of books will be displayed and you will enter the title of the book with space included.

Return: The program will ask you which book you want to return. Then it will check if you have borrowed this book before. If so, no problem, otherwise you cannot return this book. Then a check is made if you have respected the loan deadlines. It will deactivate your account if you have not followed the rules.

Add: If you are a teacher you can add a book otherwise impossible. If you are, the program will ask you for the title (space included), author, identification number and categories (selected with 1,2,3 or 4). A verification of the information will be displayed, it will suffice to put 1 for yes and 2 for no.
